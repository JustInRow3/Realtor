Life lessons such as honesty, integrity, hard work and valuing people formed character qualities that are integral in\nthe real estate venue. Jayne acquired her Real Estate license in 2010 when she went to work for Properties of\nThe Villages as an assistant. From there, she became an independent Realtor.  She went on to win \u201cRookie of the Year\u201d in 2013 and was nominated as one of three in the nation.\n\nKris DiLeva\u2019s experiences are vast. It began with operating a successful lemonade stand during her \u201ctween\u201d years. She then acquired 13 years of experience with a consumer products company in Sales and\nMarketing. This led to creating and operating three successful restaurant ventures. During the same time, Kris acquired an interest in the design of log homes and transforming those visions into their construction. Each venture required determination and an ability to think \u201coutside the box\u201d. The success of both ventures\u2019 success stemmed from atypical marketing and design strategies.\n\n\nLinda Engelbrecht\u2019s  background started when her parents bought a gift shop when she was in high school. This was the start of Linda\u2018s development in sales and marketing.  She progressed to management, then program administrator to a local nonprofit health service provider.   Upon relocation to The Villages in 2004, she acquired her real estate license. Her individual success will be a great addition to Your 24/7 Team.\n\n\nYour are going to \"LOVE\"  Your 24/7 Team!",

Years of expertise and a provided stager gave this group our business.  My parents had done a lot of \"unique\" things to the home.  The Team along with   Cindy Griffin, the home stager and decorator on the Team, turned those unique qualities into sought after assets to this home.  The fact that they brought to the table a fantastic audio/visual person to shoot the home AND a home stager made this home POP for buyers.  Their suggestions on price, their expertise in the Villages market, and the eye for maximizing the home's value made them great to work with.  Communication was key due to the fact we were listing the home from Arizona.  Not a problem, they are used to these situations and cater accordingly.  Through their extensive marketing and open houses, they found us the perfect buyer in the perfect amount of time.  My wife and I are so glad we chose the 247 TEAM!!!  Thank you so much!!",

The home was not exactly what we were looking for but the agent asked us about our   'wish list' and due to her knowledge of homes in the area, took us to the home we excitedly made an offer on and purchased! The entire experience of buying our new home and listing and selling our previous home was effortless because they walked us through every aspect. We were so impressed by their knowledge and marketing skills that my parents also used them to list their home and downsize and purchase their courtyard villa. You will be very impressed by these women. They are personable, experienced, and knowledgeable in all aspects of buying and/or selling! You won't regret contacting Your 24/7 Team for all your real estate needs",

One of the things they did for us that no other agent has   ever done was they previewed homes for us and used face time - it was as if they were showing us the home in person (saved us a great deal of time and money as we were out of state buyers). I also like (love) their willingness to facilitate a win/win for us the buyer and the seller. I will not hesitate to use them again and refer them over and over.

They did a wonderful job marketing our home and finding a qualified buyer in a relatively short amount of time.  They were always available to speak with us, even late at night and on weekends.  They worked 24/7 as their name   implies.  They provided information to us in a timely manner, explained things fully and were extremely professional.  They took care of all the details and provided extra support since we were selling the home from out of state and could not be there in person much of the time.  If we need to sell another home in The Villages, we will certainly rehire them and we would recommend them to anyone looking for an excellent real estate agent in area",
